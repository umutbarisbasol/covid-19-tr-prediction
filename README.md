# COVID-19 PREDICTIONS FOR TURKEY
The main concept of this project is analyzing the current data, and predict the total infected/recovered/death numbers by using Data Analysis algorithms. With this data, it can predict the *end date for Turkey* of this pandemic.

**THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL PROJECT, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH!**
